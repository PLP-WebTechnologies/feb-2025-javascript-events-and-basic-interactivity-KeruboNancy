        <h1>Your softness is not weakness. It’s your superpower.</h1>
        <p class="aboutParagraph">Femininity is a powerful, radiant energy rooted in softness, strength, intuition, and authenticity. It’s not about
        perfection or fitting into a box—it’s about returning to your true essence. To embrace femininity is to feel deeply,
        move gracefully, and allow yourself to receive, nurture, and create with ease. It’s found in stillness, in sensuality,
        in trusting your inner voice. When you connect with your feminine core, life begins to flow—relationships deepen,
        confidence rises, and your presence becomes magnetic. Embracing femininity from within means honoring your body, slowing
        down, setting boundaries with love, and celebrating your emotional depth, not silencing it. You don’t have to “do”
        more—you simply have to be. Let me show you how to awaken that natural feminine energy already inside you. You’re not
        broken—you’re becoming. Are you ready to reconnect with the most empowered version of yourself?</p>
